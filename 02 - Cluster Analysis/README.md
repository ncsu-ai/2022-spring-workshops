# Spring 2022 Workshop 02 - Cluster Analysis

A starter repository for AI Club at NC State's second workshop of the Spring 2022 semester which covers cluster Analysis.

### Prerequisites
1. Install [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (the workshop was created using Python 3.10, so you may experience compatibility/versioning issues with older versions of Python)

### Workshop Steps
1. [Create and activate a new virtual environment](https://python.land/virtual-environments/virtualenv)
2. Install Python dependencies
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start a Jupyter Notebook server
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Follow along in `02 - Cluster Analysis/Kubernetes.ipynb`
