    "Kubernetes allows you to deploy containerized applications to a cluster without tying them specifically to individual machines. A Kubernetes cluster is composed of two types of resources. First, the **Control Plane** handles the management of the cluster, coordinating all activities therein, such as: scheduling applications, maintaining applications' desired state, scaling applications, and rolling out application updates. Second, **Nodes** are physical computers or virtual machines that serve as worker machines in a cluster, running application instances. The following diagram illustrates the architecture of a Kubernetes cluster:\n",

Once a Deployment has been created, the control plane schedules the application instances included in that Deployment to run on individual Nodes in the cluster. A **Deployment Controller** continuously monitors the created application instances, replacing instances that go down or are deleted with an instance running on another Node in the cluster. This provides a self-healing mechanism to address machine failure or maintenance. Now that we have a better idea of what goes on inside individual Nodes in a cluster, let's take a look at an updated cluster diagram.\n",
